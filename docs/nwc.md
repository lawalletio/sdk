# NWC & Routing

Remote wallets, connection strings, and the four routing modes of a lightning address.

A lightning address on a LaWallet instance is a _router_: where an incoming
payment ends up depends on the address's **mode**. The SDK exposes the full
lifecycle — create NWC connections, inspect them, and bind them to addresses.

## Address modes

| Mode          | Payments go…                                                 | Requires                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `IDLE`        | Nowhere yet — the address exists but can't receive           | —                           |
| `ALIAS`       | Forwarded: LUD-16 resolution redirects to another address    | `redirect` (`user@host`)    |
| `PROXY_ALIAS` | Through the instance's proxy, then on to a destination       | Operator-configured proxy   |
| `CUSTOM_NWC`  | Straight into the user's own wallet via Nostr Wallet Connect | A `remoteWalletId` they own |

Pick `ALIAS` when the user already has a wallet address elsewhere and just
wants the vanity name; pick `CUSTOM_NWC` for true self-custody — invoices are
minted by _their_ wallet, the instance only routes.

```typescript
// Forward satoshi@your-domain to an existing wallet
await wallet.addresses.update('satoshi', {
  mode: 'ALIAS',
  redirect: 'satoshi@getalby.com'
})

// Or clear routing entirely
await wallet.addresses.update('satoshi', { mode: 'IDLE' })
```

## Connecting a wallet (NWC)

A _remote wallet_ wraps a [Nostr Wallet Connect](https://nwc.dev) pairing.
Create one from a `nostr+walletconnect://` string, then bind it:

```typescript
const remoteWallet = await wallet.remoteWallets.create({
  name: 'My Alby Hub',
  type: 'NWC',
  config: { connectionString: 'nostr+walletconnect://...' }
})

await wallet.addresses.update('satoshi', {
  mode: 'CUSTOM_NWC',
  remoteWalletId: remoteWallet.id
})
```

The connection string is stored encrypted server-side and never appears in
list responses. The owner can read it back explicitly:

```typescript
const secret = await wallet.remoteWallets.connectionString(remoteWallet.id)
const sats = await wallet.remoteWallets.balance(remoteWallet.id)
```

Revoking is soft — the wallet stops routing but its history survives:

```typescript
await wallet.remoteWallets.remove(remoteWallet.id)
```

## Server-minted wallets (LNCurl)

Instances with LNCurl enabled can mint a disposable custodial wallet on
demand — useful to give brand-new users something that receives immediately,
before they bring their own NWC:

```typescript
const disposable = await wallet.remoteWallets.createLncurl({ isDefault: true })
// provider === 'lncurl'; upgrade the user to their own wallet later
```

Check `settings.lncurl_enabled` from the public instance settings before
offering it.

## In React

```tsx
import { useAddress, useRemoteWallets } from '@lawallet/sdk/react'

function ConnectWallet({ username }: { username: string }) {
  const { update } = useAddress(username)
  const { create } = useRemoteWallets()

  const connect = async (connectionString: string) => {
    const remoteWallet = await create({
      name: 'My wallet',
      type: 'NWC',
      config: { connectionString }
    })
    await update({ mode: 'CUSTOM_NWC', remoteWalletId: remoteWallet.id })
  }

  return <NwcStringInput onSubmit={connect} />
}
```

Both hooks invalidate their caches after mutations, so every mounted list and
detail view refreshes on its own — and the instance also broadcasts
`addresses:updated` over SSE, which keeps _other_ tabs in sync too.

## Watching payments land

Once an address routes somewhere, received payments show up on
`useAddressInvoices(username)` (or `wallet.addresses.invoices(username)`),
live-refreshed by `invoices:updated` events. For payment flows you drive
yourself, `wallet.lud16.requestInvoice()` + `wallet.lud16.pollVerify()` give
you the public LUD-16/LUD-21 pair against any username on the instance.
