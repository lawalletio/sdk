# Registration Flow

The flagship guide: onboard a visitor from nothing to a paid lightning address bound to their npub.

This is the flow the SDK was built around: a domain owner's webapp turns a
visitor with (or without) a Nostr identity into `username@your-domain` — with
the operator's registration price paid over lightning in the middle.

The instance decides the policy, the same client code handles both:

- **Free registration** — `addresses.create()` succeeds directly.
- **Paid registration** — the create call answers **402**. The app then mints
  a lightning invoice, shows its QR, and once the payment settles proves it
  with the preimage; the server creates the address in the same transaction.

## How the paid path works

1. `POST /api/wallet/addresses` → `402 Payment Required`.
2. `POST /api/invoices` with the desired username → `{ id, bolt11, verify, expiresAt, amountSats }`.
3. The user pays `bolt11` from any wallet (QR scan or WebLN).
4. The app polls the LUD-21 `verify` URL until it answers
   `{ settled: true, preimage }`.
5. `POST /api/invoices/[id]/claim` with the preimage —
   `sha256(preimage) === paymentHash` is the proof of payment — and the
   address is created atomically for the authenticated npub.

No webhooks, no operator work in the middle, and the preimage never requires
trusting the payer's wallet: the LUD-21 verifier hands it out only after
settlement.

## One call: `claimAddress`

The SDK orchestrates the whole thing:

```typescript
import { LaWalletClient, generateSigner } from '@lawallet/sdk'

const { signer, nsec } = generateSigner() // or the user's own signer
const wallet = new LaWalletClient({
  endpoint: 'https://wallet.example.com',
  signer
})

const result = await wallet.registration.claimAddress({
  username: 'satoshi',
  onInvoice: invoice => {
    renderQr(invoice.bolt11) // called only when the instance charges
    console.log(`Pay ${invoice.amountSats} sats`)
  }
})

console.log(result) // { lightningAddress: 'satoshi@wallet.example.com', paid: true }
```

`claimAddress` resolves when the address exists — immediately on the free
path, after settlement on the paid one. It polls for the invoice's full
lifetime, treats an already-claimed invoice as success (a lost response must
not strand a paid user), and surfaces a half-configured paid mode as a typed
`LaWalletError` with code `PAID_REGISTRATION_INCOMPLETE`. Pass an
`AbortSignal` to cancel.

## In React: `useClaimAddress`

The hook version powers a full UI — it is a direct port of the claim screen
in LaWallet's own wallet, driven by the SDK:

```tsx
import { useClaimAddress } from '@lawallet/sdk/react'
import { QRCodeSVG } from 'qrcode.react'

function ClaimScreen() {
  const flow = useClaimAddress({
    onCreated: address => confetti(address)
  })

  if (flow.step === 'payment' && flow.invoice) {
    return (
      <section>
        <h2>
          Pay {flow.invoice.amountSats} sats for {flow.username}@{flow.domain}
        </h2>
        <QRCodeSVG value={flow.invoice.bolt11.toUpperCase()} size={240} />
        {flow.hasWebLn && (
          <button
            onClick={flow.handleWebLnPay}
            disabled={flow.payingWithWallet}
          >
            Pay with extension
          </button>
        )}
        <button onClick={flow.handleManualCheck} disabled={flow.manualChecking}>
          I paid — check now
        </button>
        <button onClick={flow.backFromPayment}>Cancel</button>
        {flow.paymentStatus === 'expired' && (
          <p>Invoice expired — start over.</p>
        )}
      </section>
    )
  }

  if (flow.step === 'success') {
    return <h2>⚡ {flow.claimedAddress}</h2>
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={flow.handleSubmit}>
      <input
        value={flow.username}
        onChange={e => flow.setUsername(e.target.value.toLowerCase())}
      />
      <small>
        {flow.formatError ??
          (flow.checking ? 'Checking…' : flow.available ? 'Available ✓' : '')}
      </small>
      <button disabled={flow.submitDisabled}>
        {flow.submitting ? 'Claiming…' : 'Claim'}
      </button>
      {flow.error && <p role="alert">{flow.error}</p>}
    </form>
  )
}
```

What the hook handles for you:

- **Availability** — debounced format + availability checking while typing.
- **The 402 branch** — mints the invoice and switches to the payment step.
- **Settlement** — LUD-21 polling for the invoice's whole lifetime, plus a
  manual "I paid — check now" escape hatch and a WebLN one-click path (the
  extension returns the preimage directly).
- **Refresh survival** — the pending invoice is stashed in `sessionStorage`;
  a reload lands back on the QR with polling resumed, so a user who already
  paid is never stranded.
- **Race safety** — the poller, the manual check and WebLN can't double-claim.
- **Cache invalidation** — on success, `useUser` / `useAddresses` refetch by
  themselves.

## The complete app

[`examples/example-onboarding`](../examples/example-onboarding)
wires this guide end to end — branded landing, nostr login (extension /
generated key / nsec), this claim flow, then alias or NWC configuration —
in a few hundred lines of Vite + React.

## Operator setup

Paid registration is configured on the instance (Settings → registration):
enable lightning registration, set the operator's receiving lightning address
and the price in sats. The receiving address must support LUD-21 `verify` —
the invoice endpoint refuses to mint otherwise, and `claimAddress` surfaces
that as `PAID_REGISTRATION_INCOMPLETE` rather than looping.
