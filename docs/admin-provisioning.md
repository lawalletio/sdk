# Admin Provisioning

Issue reserved lightning addresses on behalf of your users, for instances where self-registration is closed.

Some instances turn **Settings → Lightning Address → User Registration** off:
users can't create their own address, and the operator hands out reserved
names through their own process — membership, vetting, an off-platform
payment, a waiting list.

This is the API and flow for that. A visitor proves they hold a Nostr key;
your backend, holding an admin credential, provisions `name@your-domain` for
that npub — creating the account on the instance if it has never seen the key.

## The endpoint

```typescript
await admin.addresses.provision({ username: 'reserved', pubkey: '<hex>' })
```

`POST /api/lightning-addresses` requires the `addresses:write` permission
(**ADMIN** or **OPERATOR**). Unlike the self-service
`POST /api/wallet/addresses` it:

- accepts a **target pubkey** and creates that account on demand, so a key the
  instance has never seen can be handed a name;
- **bypasses the registration policy** — neither the User Registration toggle
  nor paid registration applies, because the operator is acting out-of-band.

Pubkeys go over the wire as hex. `toPubkey()` accepts either form:

```typescript
import { toPubkey } from '@lawallet/sdk'

toPubkey('npub1…') // → hex, throws on anything invalid
```

## Prove the user controls the npub

Never provision against a pubkey somebody merely typed in — anyone could
reserve a name against someone else's key. Make them sign for it.

The SDK ships both halves of the same kind-22242 (NIP-42) proof LaWallet uses
internally for identity linking and passkey registration:

```typescript
// Browser — answer the challenge your backend issued
import { signChallengeEvent } from '@lawallet/sdk'

const event = await signChallengeEvent(nonce, signer)
```

```typescript
// Your backend — verify it, and learn which pubkey it proves
import { verifyChallengeEvent } from '@lawallet/sdk'

const pubkey = verifyChallengeEvent(event, nonce, expectedPubkey)
```

`verifyChallengeEvent` checks the kind, that the `challenge` tag answers your
nonce, a ±300s freshness window, the Schnorr signature, and (when you pass
one) that it was the key you expect. Failures throw a `LaWalletError` with an
HTTP-shaped `status` and `code` (`PROOF_STALE`, `PROOF_BAD_SIGNATURE`, …), so
a backend can map them straight onto a response.

Issuing the challenge is yours to design; the example keeps it stateless with
an HMAC that carries the expiry, the target pubkey and a nonce, so there's no
table to maintain.

## Authenticating as the admin

Two ways, both genuine admin credentials — the API re-resolves the role from
the database on every request rather than trusting a claim in a token.

### NIP-98 (default)

Every request is signed with the admin key. Works on every endpoint,
including the few that only accept NIP-98.

```typescript
import { LaWalletClient, nsecSigner } from '@lawallet/sdk'

const admin = new LaWalletClient({
  endpoint: process.env.LAWALLET_ENDPOINT!,
  signer: nsecSigner(process.env.LAWALLET_ADMIN_NSEC!)
})
```

### Session JWT

Mint once, then send it as a Bearer token:

```typescript
const minter = new LaWalletClient({ endpoint, signer: nsecSigner(nsec) })
const { token } = await minter.auth.mintJwt('12h')

const admin = new LaWalletClient({ endpoint, token })
```

> **Warning** — Mint once per process
>
> `/api/jwt` is rate limited to **10 requests/min per IP** and only accepts
> NIP-98. Cache the token for its lifetime and re-mint near expiry — a mint per
> request will pass every local test and fail in production. Note also that a
> signer takes precedence over a token on the same client, so build a separate
> client (or call `setSigner(null)`) for the Bearer path.

## Keep the admin key server-side

The admin key must never reach a browser. Two habits make that structural
rather than a matter of discipline:

- Read it from an env var your bundler will not inline. In Vite, only
  `VITE_`-prefixed variables reach client code — so `LAWALLET_ADMIN_NSEC`
  cannot leak by accident.
- Give the browser a client with **no signer and no token**. It can still read
  the public endpoints (instance settings, username availability) and is
  incapable of an authenticated call.

`POST /api/jwt` is deliberately not CORS-exposed, which is the same boundary
expressed at the API: minting a session belongs on a server.

## Putting it together

```typescript
// your backend
import { verifyChallengeEvent } from '@lawallet/sdk'

// 1. unpack the challenge you issued (expiry + the pubkey it was bound to)
const { pubkey, nonce } = openChallenge(body.challenge)

// 2. the visitor must prove they hold that key, right now
verifyChallengeEvent(body.event, nonce, pubkey)

// 3. only then spend the admin credential
const address = await admin.addresses.provision({
  username: body.username,
  pubkey
})
```

## After provisioning, the address is theirs

Creating the address needs an operator; **managing it does not**. Once it
exists, the owner's own key can set an alias, bind an NWC wallet or clear
routing — and that keeps working with self-service registration switched off,
because the toggle gates _creating_ addresses, not managing your own.

```typescript
// signed by the OWNER, no admin involvement
const owner = new LaWalletClient({ endpoint, signer: theirSigner })

await owner.addresses.update('reserved', {
  mode: 'ALIAS',
  redirect: 'them@getalby.com'
})
```

`examples/example-admin-provisioning` shows this as a third screen: claim, then
configure. Returning visitors land straight on it.

## Auditing what you issued

`addresses.listAll()` returns every address on the instance (requires
`addresses:read`, so VIEWER and up) — the admin counterpart to `list()`, and a
cheap way for a backend to confirm its credential works at boot.

## Worth knowing

- **The target may already have addresses.** A provisioned address becomes
  primary only when it's the account's first; otherwise it's added alongside
  and inherits the account's default routing. It never displaces an existing
  primary.
- **`lncurl_auto_create` applies to accounts created this way.** With it on,
  provisioning for a brand-new key may also mint a wallet, so the address
  arrives already routable (`CUSTOM_NWC`) instead of `IDLE`.
- **A taken username returns 409**, including when two requests race.
- **Rate limit your own endpoints.** The instance's limiter doesn't cover your
  app, and a proof is free for keys the visitor holds — put your real
  criterion (invite code, paid order, allowlist) in front of the challenge.
