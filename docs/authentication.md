# Authentication

Nostr-signed requests: every API call is a NIP-98 event signed by the user's key.

The SDK authenticates with **Nostr events, not sessions**. For every
authenticated request it builds a kind-27235
([NIP-98](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/98.md)) event
signed by the user's key, committing to:

- the exact request URL (`u` tag),
- the HTTP method (`method` tag),
- a SHA-256 hash of the JSON body for writes (`payload` tag),
- a `created_at` within ±60 seconds of the server clock.

The event travels as `Authorization: Nostr <base64-event>`. There is no login
endpoint, nothing stored server-side, and nothing to refresh or revoke — drop
the signer and the "session" is gone. Replay is bounded by the 60-second
window and the URL/method/body commitment.

```typescript
import { LaWalletClient, nsecSigner } from '@lawallet/sdk'

const wallet = new LaWalletClient({
  endpoint: 'https://wallet.example.com',
  signer: nsecSigner('nsec1...')
})

await wallet.users.me() // signed with the user's key, automatically
```

## Signers

A signer is anything with two methods:

```typescript
interface NostrSigner {
  getPublicKey(): Promise<string>
  signEvent(event: EventTemplate): Promise<NostrEvent>
}
```

That shape is deliberately identical to `window.nostr` (NIP-07) and
structurally compatible with `@nostrify/nostrify`, NDK and nostr-tools
signers — anything that can sign a Nostr event can drive the SDK.

### Local key (nsec)

```typescript
import { nsecSigner } from '@lawallet/sdk'

const signer = nsecSigner('nsec1...') // or 64-char hex
```

Signing is local and silent — per-request signatures cost nothing.

### Browser extension (NIP-07)

```typescript
import { browserSigner, hasBrowserExtension } from '@lawallet/sdk'

if (hasBrowserExtension()) {
  const signer = browserSigner() // wraps window.nostr
}
```

> **Note** — Extension prompts
>
> Some extensions ask for confirmation on every signature. Since the SDK signs
> one event per request, tell users to allow automatic signing of **kind 27235
> (HTTP Auth)** events for your app — extensions like Alby and nos2x support
> per-kind auto-approval.

### Generated identity (onboarding)

```typescript
import { generateSigner } from '@lawallet/sdk'

const { signer, nsec, npub } = generateSigner()
// Show `nsec` to the user ONCE for backup — it IS their account.
```

### Remote signers (NIP-46) and anything else

The SDK ships no bunker client of its own — pass any external signer that
satisfies the interface. With nostr-tools:

```typescript
import { BunkerSigner, parseBunkerInput } from 'nostr-tools/nip46'
import { LaWalletClient } from '@lawallet/sdk'

const pointer = await parseBunkerInput('bunker://...')
const bunker = BunkerSigner.fromBunker(clientSecretKey, pointer!)
await bunker.connect()

const wallet = new LaWalletClient({
  endpoint: 'https://wallet.example.com',
  signer: {
    getPublicKey: () => bunker.getPublicKey(),
    signEvent: event => bunker.signEvent(event)
  }
})
```

## Live events (SSE)

`EventSource` cannot send headers, so `wallet.events.subscribe()` signs a
fresh NIP-98 event and passes it as the `?token=` query parameter instead.
Because the token rides in the query string it cannot commit to a URL
containing itself — its `u` tag is the events URL **without any query**, and
the SDK handles that (including re-signing on every reconnect).

```typescript
const unsubscribe = wallet.events.subscribe((type, data) => {
  if (type === 'invoices:updated') refreshInvoices()
})
```

## The endpoint must be the public URL

Signatures commit to the URL **the server believes it is serving**. Always
pass the instance's public origin (the one in the operator's `endpoint`
setting) — a proxy or tunnel that rewrites the origin will make every
signature invalid. This also means the SDK never builds URLs from
`window.location`; the `endpoint` option is the single source of truth.

## Clock skew

The ±60-second `created_at` window applies to **every** request. A device
clock more than a minute off will fail all authenticated calls with a 401
whose message names the timestamp — worth surfacing verbatim in your UI.

## Storing keys in your app

The SDK never persists anything. `@lawallet/sdk/react` optionally remembers a
login in `localStorage` when you pass `remember: true` — that stores the nsec
on the device, which is a custody decision: fine for low-value onboarding
keys, wrong for a user's main identity. Prefer the extension flow for
returning users; it persists nothing but a marker, and keys stay in the
extension.
